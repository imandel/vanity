What a new-school lunatic.

528
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,418
- Get over here, you wench!
- Hey, don't do this.

529
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:44,019
Come to your senses and let's talk it out.

530
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,385
Let's talk things out in a calm manner.

531
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,025
I should hang you
once I come to my senses!

532
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,723
[ Episode 2 ]

533
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,885
Fine.

534
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,055
Give me an objective reason
that's at least convincing.

535
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,178
Wait.

536
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,715
[ A reaction caused by
an external stimulus. ]

537
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,915
[ A positive sign. ]

538
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,825
[ A convincing reason? ]

539
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,225
Yes.

540
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,999
Well, it's not a very flashy reason.

541
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,265
At least let me hear it.

542
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,605
I don't know when it began,

543
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,405
but I started to hate picking up
your calls 80 percent of the time.

544
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,279
I started to think of excuses

545
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,575
instead of finding where to go
when you wanted to go on a trip.

546
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,189
I stopped saving your photos

547
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,885
whenever you sent them to me.

548
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,955
When I listened to love songs,

549
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,525
I started to only think
of the singer who sang it.

550
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,639
Why that crude punk.

551
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,139
What a brazen rascal.

552
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,535
I want to hit him right on his syrinx

553
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,065
real hard.

554
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,349
- Right. He's so brazen.
- What a piece of garbage.

555
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,605
Sorry, but can everyone please quiet down?

556
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,585
What a detailed reasoning.

557
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,255
- Is that it?
- No.

558
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,395
This is the main reason.

559
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,635
I started to hate eating with you.

560
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,539
- Gosh.
- What is she going to do?

561
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,105
- How could he say that?
- Poor her.

562
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,775
- What is up with him?
- Exactly. Oh, no.

563
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,019
You should be willing to eat
with someone you love, right?

564
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,085
But

565
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,595
with you, it became a duty.

566
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,325
I didn't eat because I wanted to,

567
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,395
but because I had to.

568
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,435
If you were going to end things like this,

569
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,845
why did you send me a ring photo?

570
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,445
That was...

571
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,159
Hey, what should I do?

572
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,959
- What should I do?
- Why?

573
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,155
What's wrong, sir?

574
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,589
I accidentally sent the ring photo
to Do-hee.

575
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,959
- Gosh.
- You should always double-check

576
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,599
the photos when you're two-timing.

577
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,929
I checked the photos,

578
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,335
but I accidentally sent it to her.

579
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,865
- How should I...
- Goodness.

580
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,865
What should I do?

581
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,835
Just tell her that your friend is using it
for his proposal.

582
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,109
Tell her you just wanted
to ask an opinion about it.

583
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,505
- Good one.
- Oh, right.

584
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,975
That photo?

585
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,615
I sent it by accident.

586
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,785
I'm really sorry.

587
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,285
I will accept any punishment.

588
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,155
My mom told me

589
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,965
I should just cut your thing off
if you ever cheat on me.

590
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,835
Just like how we cut
the tip of pickled radish.

591
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,039
That's a bit...

592
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,179
The tip of pickled radish
can be ground and put in dumplings

593
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,975
and seasonings though. But yours

594
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,545
is useless.

595
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,985
Just take good care of it.

596
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,355
- Goodness.
- No way.

597
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,025
- Thank you, Do-hee.
- It's been awful,

598
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,055
and let's never see each other again.

599
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,165
You scumbag.

600
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,365
I will take the champagne.

601
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,135
I have a happy occasion to celebrate.
since I got rid of trash like you.

602
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,475
You have it.

603
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,315
Do-hee...

604
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,775
Do-hee.

605
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,935
Do-hee.

606
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,775
Hey.

607
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,285
Do-hee.

608
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,485
Do-hee.

609
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,499
- Let go.
- If you leave like this...

610
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,395
Do you want me to break it with
your forehead to see what's inside?

611
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,575
[ Dyspnoea. ]

612
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,005
[ Tachycardia. ]

613
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,645
[ Panic attack caused by excitement. ]

614
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,615
- Wait.
- Don't follow her.

615
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,459
But still...

616
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,225
If you want to follow her,
break up with me first.

617
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,085
I'm sorry. Let's go.

618
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,255
Eun-seo.

619
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,725
This is great.

620
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,005
This is just amazing.

621
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,115
Why are you doing this again?

622
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,955
This is pathetic.

623
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,025
Doctor.

624
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,065
Doctor?

625
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,095
Yes?

626
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,869
I'm sorry. Let's start over.

627
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,535
Do you think she will be okay?

628
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,349
She will need some time,
but eventually, she will be fine.

629
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,475
How can you be sure?

630
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,049
- Excuse me?
- Only those who have been hurt

631
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,015
can understand those who are hurt.

632
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,385
She's betrayed. She can't be fine.

633
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,295
[ Why do you ]

634
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,865
look like you haven't lost anything?

635
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,865
I'm sure she needs someone like you.

636
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,405
Well...

637
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,309
I'm not sure.
I'm not good at relationships myself.

638
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,675
- I don't know...
- Doctor.

639
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,345
Please help her.

640
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,819
If she recovers,

641
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,985
I will feel like I can be saved as well.

642
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,685
Everyone!

643
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,995
The doctor sitting here

644
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,965
is a famous psychiatrist.

645
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,135
- Wait...
- This doctor

646
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,139
will help the woman over there.

647
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,465
Wait. What are you doing?

648
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,545
Doctor.

649
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,615
- Wait...
- Doctor.

650
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,385
Doctor.

651
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,219
I will cheer for you, Doctor.

652
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,455
- Please help her.
- Doctor.

653
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,425
He's going to help her!

654
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:08,995
Good luck!

655
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,705
You're awesome, Doctor!

656
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,715
- Taxi!
- You got this!

657
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,049
Please follow the white car in the front.

658
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,855
- Over there.
- Okay.

659
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,355
Okay, bye!

660
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,965
What a dynamic day.

661
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,865
Maybe I should buy a lottery.

662
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,605
I'm sure I can win the first prize.

663
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,819
What is it that you did so wrong?

664
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,115
Tell me about it.

665
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,115
Excuse me? I'm not the one...

666
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,429
I have been driving a cab
in Jeju Island for 27 years now.

667
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,229
I have seen over 70,000 men and women

668
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,665
who drove home with rental cars
after having fights.

669
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,669
- That's not it.
- I understand.

670
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,465
So what did you do?

671
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,375
Did you have different opinions
on the itinerary?

672
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,979
Or did she make you tell her
about your memories here

673
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,175
with your ex-girlfriend
with leading questions?

674
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,449
I got it.

675
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,119
"Don't you know why I'm angry?"

676
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,689
- Is this what happened?
- Can you just focus on following her?

677
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,885
That's not it.

678
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,755
Sure, sure. I got it.

679
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,015
Could you please stop the car here?

680
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,929
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

681
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,289
This place is
a popular photo spot these days.

682
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,859
Make up with her and deep kiss her.

683
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,029
- Okay.
- You can do it!

684
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,899
- Okay, okay.
- Good.

685
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,225
Thank you!

686
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,705
Gosh, he's cute.
I wonder if the girl is pretty too.

687
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,545
Darn it. I came here to
get some fresh air.

688
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:42,145
But only the salty air is
coming through my nose.

689
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,745
My goodness. What's happening?

690
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,425
What on earth is she doing?

691
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:01,195
I might actually end up falling.

692
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:02,835
Excuse me!

693
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,265
Hey!

694
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,635
What are you doing?

695
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,005
What's his problem?

696
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,735
Oh, no!

697
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,005
Goodness.

698
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,575
Hey.

699
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,845
Wake up!

700
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,285
Wait. What?

701
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,225
Are you okay?

702
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,725
Who are you?
Why did you suddenly run to me?

703
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,065
I didn't know you would dodge like that.

704
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,769
Of course I dodged.

705
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,495
I can't just let some man tackle me.

706
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,405
