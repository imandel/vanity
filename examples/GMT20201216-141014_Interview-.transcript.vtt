Okay, so

13
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.120
Dana Chermesh: Ya know, it's like

14
00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:03.420
Dana Chermesh: 25 years 2020 I don't know 20 something. Fine. Hi Dr where we are in New York top right, we were here during covered. So what's a bit of called for us.

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.180
Dana Chermesh: Media. We are here in Park Slope.

16
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.230
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Brooklyn and can you start the application to track your location.

17
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.170
Dana Chermesh: Yeah, I will. So it will I guess you would not see me for a minute.

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.000
Dana Chermesh: So, yeah.

19
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.440
Dana Chermesh: Right. Yep. Okay. And I will turn my camera so you can see this

20
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.260
Dana Chermesh: Park Slope Brooklyn where on street.

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.240
Dana Chermesh: The corner of Sixth Avenue and that's where I leave

22
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:52.980
Dana Chermesh: My kids Baker used to be right down the street. Maybe we'll go there. But of course, when college started there was no they care anymore. So we did not enjoy the proximity

23
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.960
Dana Chermesh: To their school

24
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:21.870
Dana Chermesh: And we were here. Maybe I'll start with me a bit about themselves. So I'm married to a man and we are here is located in Park Slope for the past three and a half years. I'm an architect from a VM and we moved here because I studied urban data science in Mr Lucas and you just caught me

25
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.150
Dana Chermesh: Cross the street.

26
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.180
Dana Chermesh: I am today and entrepreneur in residence futures. I work on my venture and urban tech venture to

27
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:57.240
Dana Chermesh: Democratize city planning or and urban development processes through engaging communities, our immersive community participation and through augmented reality. Basically the idea is that you could walk down the street, as I do now and see proposals on top of the built environment.

28
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:12.090
Dana Chermesh: But this aside when we started our baby Rona, she was seven weeks old, when lockdown started back in March 2020. We have also Itamar and i a

29
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.550
Dana Chermesh: boy and a girl twins.

30
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.840
Dana Chermesh: Four years old. Back then, now almost five

31
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.690
Dana Chermesh: So it was a bit hectic and of course we could not really move anywhere.

32
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.860
Dana Chermesh: With a newborn and the kiddos. We have also Bella 70 pounds dog.

33
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:49.140
Dana Chermesh: So we were here all along, and I was on maternity leave. So I was lucky to not have to juggle work into the lockdown days and I was just with their children and

34
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.230
Dana Chermesh: The same was for my husband for a while, at the beginning of this period.

35
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.390
Dana Chermesh: And I think

36
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.060
Dana Chermesh: This week's were

37
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.090
Dana Chermesh: Very special for sure intense and crazy

38
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:16.980
Dana Chermesh: Very scary. I think we are. We live on the first floor ground ground floor. So, in the very hard weeks of

39
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.150
Dana Chermesh: March, April, we heard ambulances, like every two, three minutes.

40
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.350
Dana Chermesh: But I can say that from day one. And all along these

41
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:49.050
Dana Chermesh: Hard month we felt the how strong of the community and we found a solidarity through the streets that we that I now walk you walk you through. So this is 11th STREET AND soon we'll get to seven Avenue, which is kind of the hearts of the of this neighborhood.

42
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.380
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: And you can you explain how did you feel the solidarity or how was it manifested can be in the mobile space if

43
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.980
Someone

44
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.550
Dana Chermesh: Yeah, and I will get to a point that I can show you. So when I will

45
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.100
Dana Chermesh: Cross the street. Now we will get to a coffee shop that was opened.

46
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:26.460
Dana Chermesh: Maybe mid February or beginning of March, like I'm like two weeks before lockdown. And it was at first it's a block away from our house or just block the block and this is the official

47
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.300
Dana Chermesh: At first we were like, oh my god, I'm so miserable. They just hope and they will lose so much money.

48
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.190
Dana Chermesh: But then they have

49
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:50.160
Dana Chermesh: They have a window which made them like the best place to buy coffee and they have coffee. I'm not not affiliated with them. By the way, it's not

50
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.500
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: But

51
00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:01.470
Dana Chermesh: Here's this window and back in the very, very hot days you would see people succeed, apart from here until the next block.

52
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.390
Dana Chermesh: So I think you felt that people, although they are

53
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.970
Dana Chermesh: Under they are

54
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.170
Dana Chermesh: Worried, and of course, everyone was

55
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.900
Dana Chermesh: Financially by copying.

56
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.330
Dana Chermesh: People came and bother coffee and to hear

57
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:41.490
Dana Chermesh: In everywhere along all the street and I think from the very beginning, you saw people with masks and like nodding to each other to strangers industry, understanding that everyone is going through something really hard people asking each other. How are they

58
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.640
Dana Chermesh: And

59
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.440
Dana Chermesh: When the opening started kind of like

60
00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:07.560
Dana Chermesh: June, but maybe I'll go back first. Sorry. So another thing that was very special in these days, it was the beginning of the spring and with children with young children, even in the hard days you try to do at least like a short walk

61
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:15.150
Dana Chermesh: Across the block to, you know, breathe air and we counted the trees that were

62
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:27.390
Dana Chermesh: No flourishing in the spring. So every day we we kind of like counted how many got their new flowers already new lives and

63
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:42.990
Dana Chermesh: The lives are beautiful in that period. So it was something very, very nice. And when you work with young children. Everybody kind of even more nodding to you and happy and try to to be compression and helping

64
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.860
Dana Chermesh: When the opening began

65
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.950
Dana Chermesh: And it was also Warner.

66
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:59.370
Dana Chermesh: You could see and I added very strongly that walking in the street and doing this daily walks with the needs

67
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:12.750
Dana Chermesh: Of this walk teaches them so many values about neighborhood and community because every day we decided we will buy our okay or treating. Another place.

68
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.160
Dana Chermesh: I'm taking us to to Prospect Park, by the way.

69
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.730
Dana Chermesh: Which was also a big part of

70
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.900
Dana Chermesh: These days for us.

71
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:35.880
Dana Chermesh: And so we were buying I explained to them and they understood very quickly that we need to support small businesses. So we bought like a cookie or my friend or my coffee.

72
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:45.990
Dana Chermesh: Each time in the different coffee shop and again you felt the solidarity between their businesses and their workers and that community.

73
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.600
Dana Chermesh: When Black Lives Matter movement also

74
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.100
Dana Chermesh: Evolved and was the big news and everything.

75
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.320
Dana Chermesh: Our daily walk

76
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:20.460
Dana Chermesh: Transferred from cutting trees to counting Black Lives Matter and thank yous science on the houses and if you're curious in our part of the neighborhood. My one girl counted at for like lives matter signs and 73 rainbow signs.

77
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.460
Dana Chermesh: So that was another thing to

78
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.730
Dana Chermesh: Know that we, that was very

79
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.890
Dana Chermesh: Very common in our daily walks and

80
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.560
Dana Chermesh: Lasting. I mean, I remember a little together today, the

81
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:52.290
Dana Chermesh: More open again, I think it was maybe I maybe every parent was here to remember that it's a burden to young children, but this was one of the most magical

82
00:09:53.430 --> 00:10:01.620
Dana Chermesh: Moments to see the kids after month without playground going to getting into the park and not passing

83
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.330
Dana Chermesh: An empty playground, but going into it and start playing

84
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.350
Dana Chermesh: We we walk even earlier. I didn't talk about it, but this

85
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.540
Dana Chermesh: Outdoors dining that now we see one of them. That is not in

86
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.930
Dana Chermesh: Our way back from that.

87
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.960
Dana Chermesh: From the park, we will

88
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.860
Dana Chermesh: We will go. Next thing, but I think that was also one of the

89
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.240
Dana Chermesh: Very exciting things and he like touching

90
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.330
Dana Chermesh: To me, even to see

91
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.700
Dana Chermesh: The restaurants.

92
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.920
Dana Chermesh: expanding their outdoor dining to to meet the six feet.

93
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:52.710
Dana Chermesh: Requirements and the city that allowed the reducing parking, which has an armed police

94
00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:11.580
Dana Chermesh: All of us know that if you would tell anyone. A year ago that you're going to reduce parking to allow small businesses or restaurants to expand to the street. No one will think, we think that even possible. And then it just happened. And now come to be

95
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.970
Dana Chermesh: And they think, people love it and even now, when it got

96
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.660
Dana Chermesh: You see people and, you know, sitting outside. Maybe not today.

97
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.200
Dana Chermesh: I reasonably call this people are still outside

98
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:43.470
Dana Chermesh: And people still like try to support businesses, by the way, if you look on the on the businesses themselves, they only did they also did

99
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.420
Dana Chermesh: Very

100
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.910
Dana Chermesh: Beautiful things like

101
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.800
Dana Chermesh: Merging kitchens to allow

102
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.770
Dana Chermesh: Themselves to work more efficient and helping each other with deliveries.

103
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.430
Dana Chermesh: And I mean everywhere around maybe now.

104
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.080
Dana Chermesh: We need to know

105
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.740
Dana Chermesh: There were signs in their windows.

106
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.290
Dana Chermesh: thank us to the

107
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.880
Dana Chermesh: First responders and special workers, the delivery.

108
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.530
Dana Chermesh: And of course, many, many black lives matter.

109
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.620
Dana Chermesh: I think you felt all the time, and also in the part that will get in

110
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:35.340
Dana Chermesh: Front of people together and walk to the park for us because we have children. And second, because we have Bella dog so

111
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.930
Dana Chermesh: dog runs were not a place to be, but

112
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.840
Dana Chermesh: The unleash hours.

113
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:52.110
Dana Chermesh: In the early morning in the park where the place that we could take her and release her and meet people outdoors.

114
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.180
Dana Chermesh: Safely and, you know, read some air. So

115
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.040
Dana Chermesh: I think that was that's also very, very strong in my memories of this, this time.

116
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.130
Dana Chermesh: What else they can

117
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:17.790
Dana Chermesh: I mean, I, I must admit that I finished my going to prepare an album on this.

118
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.320
Dana Chermesh: If you're curious, it was 116 days without

119
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.850
Dana Chermesh: Before the kids got back to summer them.

120
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.330
Dana Chermesh: And right after that I

121
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.620
Dana Chermesh: Worked so it was a very special time for me, I guess.

122
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.200
Dana Chermesh: Many parents mean

123
00:13:47.490 --> 00:14:00.930
Dana Chermesh: I guess my children will not remember that. But as a parent, I'm sure that my parents did not have this very intense time that they were just to have them with us. And I think that's

124
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.380
Dana Chermesh: The craziness. Although their fear and uncertainty.

125
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.620
Dana Chermesh: We felt very strongly that this is something that

126
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.100
Dana Chermesh: Acne us as a family.

127
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.120
Dana Chermesh: And got to know and

128
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.440
Dana Chermesh: I were the children. By the way, the playground.

129
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:46.680
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Can you can you say something about the amount of people in the streets like when we walk, walk through the neighborhood, we could see very little people. I assume it's because of the weather in the early hour

130
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:47.760
Yeah.

131
00:14:49.020 --> 00:15:04.020
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: But can you recall differences likely because it's a residential neighborhood. It would be very different from working in Manhattan, even before Corbett, but was there any changes like

132
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.630
Dana Chermesh: This yeah i think that

133
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:20.880
Dana Chermesh: That it's just whether that people are less industries and now I will take us back through nine street which is there like big commercial street. I guess the neighborhood.

134
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.300
Dana Chermesh: And you will see on Seventh Avenue. The one we're going through the playground.

135
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.920
Dana Chermesh: Entire event, they're

136
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.670
Very

137
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.930
Dana Chermesh: Again, scary or hard weeks of gang of

138
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.180
Dana Chermesh: People weren't talking about how Manhattan became a ghost town.

139
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:51.900
Dana Chermesh: This wasn't a ghost town. I mean, you felt that people are going through hard times, of course, people were less in the street, for sure.

140
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.510
Dana Chermesh: But it wasn't empty it wasn't scary. It wasn't full of

141
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.240
Dana Chermesh: No promises or

142
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.130
Dana Chermesh: It was still you saw the community here.

143
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.260
Dana Chermesh: Because it's a neighborhood of families mostly

144
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:22.050
Dana Chermesh: You is the family. I mean, of course, every family with her. Is it situation and families with children could move to

145
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.440
Dana Chermesh: To I don't know Airbnb in upstate or to their parents if they are around but

146
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.520
Dana Chermesh: But many families stayed here and

147
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:48.870
Dana Chermesh: Also, in terms of finding help with the kids. So our we could find an any I guess more quickly. When I got back to work and from a larger pool that's a

148
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.430
Dana Chermesh: Much more than, than if we were in the suburbs, I guess, or in rural areas.

149
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:07.890
Dana Chermesh: But again, with thinking about Manhattan versus Brooklyn. This wasn't a ghost town and as an urban center.

150
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.860
Dana Chermesh: All this mixed use discourse that is

151
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.110
Dana Chermesh: That exists for the past. I know 16 years now.

152
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:33.930
Dana Chermesh: suddenly got very, very clear, like the message was very clear why you need an excuse neighborhoods and to me, I felt that talking about resiliency of

153
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.090
Dana Chermesh: The resilience resiliency of New York City is not

154
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:45.300
Dana Chermesh: Or Broadway or Wall Street, because all of these places where it could be abundant.

155
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.910
Dana Chermesh: But it's, it's this name is neighborhood.

156
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.680
Dana Chermesh: family oriented.

157
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.980
Dana Chermesh: Children oriented, if I may say

158
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.500
Dana Chermesh: Now I'm going to

159
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.560
Dana Chermesh: When we get back to Seventh Avenue, which is two blocks away.

160
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.650
Dana Chermesh: This is more like a commercial

161
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.760
Dana Chermesh: Arguments

162
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.550
Dana Chermesh: darting mixed use then they think now with

163
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.590
Dana Chermesh: The thought of also wedding residential

164
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:56.430
Dana Chermesh: Residential and uses to to places like SOHO or up zoning displaces rather than up zoning.

165
00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.020
Dana Chermesh: Know,

166
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:12.120
Dana Chermesh: low income neighborhoods or places that will only cause speculations of real estate and will not necessarily benefit the residents, but using the high

167
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.040
Dana Chermesh: net value.

168
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.730
Dana Chermesh: Of Manhattan to allow more housing. Well, I think it will stress.

169
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.540
Dana Chermesh: These neighborhoods and will not allow them

170
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.770
Dana Chermesh: And on people think, I mean, I really did I go along the coverage on

171
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:49.620
Dana Chermesh: All these cars. Oh my god. People are living cities did nine density in danger. I don't think so. I think people especially New Yorkers. I mean, we're here because we we want the

172
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:57.030
Dana Chermesh: The meeting or the interactions with other people. We want the diversity.

173
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:04.500
Dana Chermesh: Is not is not one of our patients moving to

174
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:12.930
Dana Chermesh: Brooklyn coming complex like one basically everyone around you aren't the same as young

175
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.190
Dana Chermesh: Used to give our children through their day to day lives.

176
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:24.120
Dana Chermesh: More diversity and more exposure to people that are different than them and Park Slope is

177
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:33.450
Dana Chermesh: Not the most diverse neighborhood, let's say, but at least in daycares and now they're in Pre K. So in public school

178
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.500
Dana Chermesh: They do get to see much more diversity or not see to to live with.

179
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.110
Dana Chermesh: such diverse

180
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.380
Dana Chermesh: Community and we could give them back home.

181
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.680
Dana Chermesh: I think this is something to

182
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:54.660
Dana Chermesh: Remember,

183
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.510
And

184
00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.240
Dana Chermesh: Donations

185
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:25.980
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: You had some great observations about the differences between a Manhattan to your residential area and I had two related

186
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.820
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Questions.

187
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.350
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: One of them.

188
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.400
Is about

189
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:41.460
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Noting to people in the street, as you mentioned before. Do you know the people that lives around you or like do you pass familiar faces every day.

190
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:50.010
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: And the second thing was about the rates of infection if you know anything about the rates of infection immune

191
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.520
Dana Chermesh: Function or

192
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.190
Dana Chermesh: Neighbor.

193
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.320
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Overall,

194
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.420
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Or anything that you can tell us about

195
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.980
Dana Chermesh: Yeah. So let's start with the second question, I think.

196
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.770
Dana Chermesh: One of the better.

197
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.780
Dana Chermesh: Places to be in terms of zip codes and writing sections on. So now I mean now everyone is increasing, but

198
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.390
Dana Chermesh: But by the way, our kids.

199
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.740
Dana Chermesh: Their public school is in

200
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.680
Dana Chermesh: Southeastern to Prospect Park neighborhood in Windsor terrace.

201
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.480
Dana Chermesh: orange and yellow.

202
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:42.150
Dana Chermesh: And we are first question. So we moved an apartment within the neighborhood, but two avenues. So that's a big change, I guess.

203
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:55.410
Dana Chermesh: In the neighborhood scale right before the lockdown. So again, as I said, we had a new baby so we meant that anyway to move to a bigger place so we didn't know that.

204
00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:10.110
Dana Chermesh: The neighbors or around, but because the kids Baker was so close. So their friends were kind of from from around, but the people that we know that we do not know them.

205
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.830
Dana Chermesh: Oh no thinkers again i like i see their homes teacher

206
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:23.730
Dana Chermesh: And as high as basically course we know that the people from the

207
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.340
Dana Chermesh: Coffee shop or they're the best that is right next to the coffee shop.

208
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:35.190
Dana Chermesh: But look, that's basically we don't

209
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.780
Dana Chermesh: Our friends. Most of them are not from this neighborhood.

210
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:59.490
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: So you told us about your a routine during the epidemic with the daily walks with the kids in the neighborhood. Can you maybe compare that to your daily routine before the epidemic.

211
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:02.850
Dana Chermesh: Well,

212
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:11.670
Dana Chermesh: Because I also having babies, I guess, like in pre maternity leave.

213
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.790
Dana Chermesh: I worked before. Different me or before I gave birth Rona in my book.

214
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.330
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: So,

215
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.400
Dana Chermesh: My daily routine was to put the kids.

216
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.700
Dana Chermesh: In daycare and taking bike.

217
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:33.390
Dana Chermesh: 15 minutes back to read a book, which is another amazing neighborhood and maybe I need to do another work there, but I wasn't doing coffee.

218
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.830
Dana Chermesh: So that was my venues in working

219
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.420
Dana Chermesh: In an urban design houses and a

220
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.120
Dana Chermesh: Viking back to

221
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:48.510
Dana Chermesh: But

222
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:54.120
Dana Chermesh: I think, well, and the big change of courses.

223
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.670
Dana Chermesh: And now they do.

224
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.550
Dana Chermesh: Maybe talk about that later phase, which means

225
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:23.400
Dana Chermesh: And here we just did to know that we are back in seven, seven years. So that's like more commercial and I will help us here.

226
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.730
Dana Chermesh: Are people in

227
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.240
Dana Chermesh: Coffee shops.

228
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:39.900
Dana Chermesh: So yeah, maybe let's talk about this the beginning of the school year, because that

229
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:51.960
Dana Chermesh: I was a bit mad about the city at this point because okay march came and no one knew what it is and we had to close everything, of course. But then when September came

230
00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.210
Dana Chermesh: I think the city could

231
00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:01.590
Dana Chermesh: could prepare better for having kids at schools because, are you

232
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.950
Dana Chermesh: Not do well with zoom

233
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:12.480
Dana Chermesh: And it is a burden on Oracle parents and are not something

234
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:24.510
Dana Chermesh: I think. And of course, you might remember that are not super sprinters. And on top of all we had always still have

235
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.260
Dana Chermesh: under utilized space.

236
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.390
Dana Chermesh: Of

237
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:31.980
Dana Chermesh: Not

238
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.120
Dana Chermesh: Only open

239
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.240
Dana Chermesh: Schools, because we don't have place or space to do

240
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:49.140
Dana Chermesh: The reasonable social distancing that I find very supportive of doing that. And I'm supportive of everything that

241
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.100
Dana Chermesh: He's doing and how they're dealing with that.

242
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.400
Dana Chermesh: But the city could

243
00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.520
Dana Chermesh: We were

244
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.100
Dana Chermesh: And I can you adjust your earphones.

245
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.690
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Because you're losing your voice.

246
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.000
Dana Chermesh: I hear me now.

247
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.310
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Yeah, but it's kind of moving in and out. So try to keep them steady

248
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.320
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Sorry for interrupting you.

249
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:20.160
Dana Chermesh: And so I had this idea that if we could, in the past where

250
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.730
Dana Chermesh: Classes expand into

251
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.440
Dana Chermesh: Indoor spaces that we're not utilizing recently.

252
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.710
Dana Chermesh: And we could maybe train

253
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.220
Dana Chermesh: Some of them. Many, many unemployed.

254
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.960
Dana Chermesh: To

255
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.710
Dana Chermesh: Be teachers, but

256
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.450
Dana Chermesh: But they can

257
00:27:43.050 --> 00:28:04.320
Dana Chermesh: Or they can help with logistics, we could find some space and we have here the why close to here. We are now in on seven and seven. So the wise on nine three and six like right here. I was closed until recently, and knowing we have them Methodist Hospital.

258
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:10.170
Dana Chermesh: Again, very close. And maybe that's why we heard all the sample insurance coverage.

259
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:18.210
Dana Chermesh: And anyway, I think the sneaky could prepare better for this.

260
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.120
Dana Chermesh: School year and now with the

261
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:27.540
Dana Chermesh: Recent closing of schools and of course everybody understood pretty quickly that it was

262
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.910
Dana Chermesh: A bit rush to to close close again.

263
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.940
Dana Chermesh: This for the lower

264
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.540
Dana Chermesh: grades of the younger children.

265
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:50.100
Dana Chermesh: So yeah, I think it could it could have businesses with rent if we could

266
00:28:52.440 --> 00:29:08.580
Dana Chermesh: Use their spaces to get children or four different pods. So we for talking again on my personal experience. So as you see, I'm jumping here between Albany Stadium, to me, a mother to three young children.

267
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.940
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: Exactly why we wanted to talk to you.

268
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.530
Dana Chermesh: Thank you.

269
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:23.430
Dana Chermesh: Yeah, the overall, I didn't know holistic perspective. I guess I mean each has or each role.

270
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:36.900
Dana Chermesh: Improving me as like being a mother makes me a better urban planner urbanist and having the word been Lance's helps with with motherhood.

271
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.570
Dana Chermesh: But

272
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:49.740
Dana Chermesh: Yeah. So going back to my personal or our personal experience. The kids are in two different

273
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:58.500
Dana Chermesh: Childcare say they are in public school public school is on the two days a week, and every other

274
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:00.750
Week.

275
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:13.470
Dana Chermesh: The help for that would enrichment program.

276
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.000
Dana Chermesh: They go thousand eight days so

277
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:25.290
Dana Chermesh: I must raise children in this times because they are so resilient and so strong.

278
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:32.880
Dana Chermesh: Overall, they're like just happy, no matter what, knock on wood and

279
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.280
Dana Chermesh: If for us parents when it started, we were like, oh my god, two different

280
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.980
Dana Chermesh: groups of kids and two different

281
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:52.470
Dana Chermesh: Two different sets of features and that's like so confusing and how they deal with that. And they're like, oh my god, amazing two groups of friends and do sense of details. That's fine.

282
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:59.160
Dana Chermesh: So praise really I'm uploading and to all children.

283
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:01.140
Dana Chermesh: During covered

284
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.820
Dana Chermesh: I think we can learn from them.

285
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.620
Dana Chermesh: So much about

286
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.240
Dana Chermesh: optimism and

287
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.610
Dana Chermesh: Resiliency

288
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.860
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: And also when you know when you mentioned their ages. It was amazing to think that

289
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:23.220
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: If there were five for another five. It's like a fifth of their lives. Actually, they spent during the pandemic.

290
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.750
Dana Chermesh: Yeah, totally.

291
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.660
Dana Chermesh: And you know, when you, when we watch

292
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.040
Dana Chermesh: Movies with them.

293
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:39.990
Dana Chermesh: And they seen the movie like the crowd together or people hugging like oh it was before the coronavirus I mean they notice everything

294
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.210
Dana Chermesh: Here is by the way.

295
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:56.190
Dana Chermesh: An example of this outdoors dining, you probably got from all your interviews in different places in the city. But I'm always happy. I mean, it makes me happy to see this.

296
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:10.860
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: And actually it's great that you took us from the residential neighborhood to the more commercial Street and as you're walking in the street, we could see a lot of differences between where you started, that the tour to the street.

297
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:13.110
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: So,

298
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.670
Dana Chermesh: Okay, maybe I needed to to start here and then walk to the park.

299
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:33.330
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: No, no. It's excellent that we're there after seeing the residential area. And maybe you can also talk about a little bit about that. Like the different differences in district before and after the pandemic, besides the outdoor dining that we just saw.

300
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.210
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: On the census.

301
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:41.340
Dana Chermesh: Yeah, so I think we have this which is Seventh Avenue and Fifth Avenue, which is

302
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.950
Dana Chermesh: Maybe a bit more

303
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:44.910
Dana Chermesh: Rough but

304
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.500
Dana Chermesh: Properly.

305
00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:55.530
Dana Chermesh: And nice place to walk and also there was another leg on there. But I think what was most

306
00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:01.830
Dana Chermesh: Apparent during the weeks was again the solidarity between the businesses.

307
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:08.580
Dana Chermesh: And between the their community and their businesses. So it would like to think to

308
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:14.730
Dana Chermesh: To buy your coffee every time from another place. So to do your grocery

309
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.640
Dana Chermesh: In different places or even

310
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.430
Dana Chermesh: Do not

311
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.300
Dana Chermesh: Take college or something and

312
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.720
Dana Chermesh: I'm sure as it was for us.

313
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.930
Dana Chermesh: Like I was on the printer name.

314
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.050
Dana Chermesh: Your baby and

315
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:36.750
Dana Chermesh: We were threat.

316
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.050
Dana Chermesh: I'm sure most of the people were

317
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:47.760
Dana Chermesh: But still we felt like this obligation to, you know, have the economy somehow

318
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:56.850
Dana Chermesh: And we did what we could, and I am sure I mean I know that we weren't on the one until we have more

319
00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.010
Dana Chermesh: Nice.

320
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.100
Dana Chermesh: So I think that

321
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:08.790
Dana Chermesh: Went down. It was dining started, I really felt that it was you know vacation in their

322
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:26.160
Dana Chermesh: micro level, but much more exciting than, you know, bigger innovation, things like you really sell how every business here is figuring out how to best llandysul designing how to

323
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.530
Dana Chermesh: How to keep everyone safe.

324
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.580
Dana Chermesh: At the beginning, there were, I don't know. Cars hits this

325
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.740
Dana Chermesh: The corner of these. So I think that was a bit of an issue.

326
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:56.040
Dana Chermesh: But yeah, I felt again between the businesses or with the kitchens and and all and between the people at the businesses and you really felt it like walking in the streets.

327
00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.090
Dana Chermesh: And oh, yeah, that's my observation.

328
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:09.000
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: And that's, that's a nice observation to finish the interview way because we also want to be respectful of your time.

329
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:19.080
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: First, so I'm gonna stop the video and you're going to stop the tracking and

330
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.990
Sharon Yavo Ayalon: continue this conversation in Hebrew.
